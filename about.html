      <p>I always thought the conventional way to life was to go to college, pick a major, and stick to one career for the rest of your life. At 21, freshly graduated out of college, do you really have your career all figured out? I thought I did.
      </p>
      <p>As a little girl, I had so many interests and passions. In High School, I was first exposed to the language of html when Angelfire websites were a “thing”, following the blogging era with Xanga and Blogger, which I loved stylizing. In
        college, my major was Computer Science for a semester until I realized learning Java put me to sleep, so I quickly switched and finished with a Business degree with a concentration in Finance.</p>
      <p>Starting my career at a financial software company, I worked my way up the corporate ladder within 4 years. I solved client issues everyday with my communication and analytical skills as a Client Services Representative, continued learning
        by taking over 20+ internal certifications to become Senior, then built empathy to form my role as a Team Lead, where I loved mentoring others and leading my team to succeed. My career took a turn when I made one of the hardest decisions in
        my life at the time to quit my job and follow my heart pursuing my passion in photography. This was where my empathy & passion for all things LOVE was expressed and my self-motivation, grit, and hustle of entrepreneurship was born. My last
        role in Business Development for 3 years made me learn first hand the gravity of creating human-centric designs and products around your customers first.</p>
      <h3>“...the gravity of creating human-centric designs and products around your customers first.”</h3>
      <h3>“...blending both my business and creative side together to help discover, adapt, evolve, and grow.”</h3>
      <p>I’ve accepted it’s natural to evolve to look for a greater meaning to life. I have a lot of goals and ideas I want to contribute and accomplish in my lifetime, and UX/UI design blends both my business and creative side together to help
        discover, adapt, evolve, and grow.</p>
      <p>When I’m not busy “working”, my energy is expended towards health & wellness, food, wine, photography, and connecting with others over a good coffee &/or espresso. I have an innate love to help and connect with others, to help others first
        before my own needs, and do good in this world. I aspire to reach some of my life goals which include humanitarian & philanthropy work.</p>
      <p>I also have a mission to make an impact so our next female generation becomes strong, confident, positive, and influential women.</p>
      <p>I’d love to connect and have a great conversation over coffee!</p>
