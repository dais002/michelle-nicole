        Summary
      </h3>
      <p>
        When people start their fitness journey, for most, it takes years to figure out what they really like to do. FitPath, the fitness cloud storage & search engine was created to disrupt the fitness industry and allow people of all ages and
        experiences to easily discover their perfect workouts. With the help of AI and our database of workouts from all over the internet, FitPath will know exactly what users are enjoying so each new workout that you crush is better than the last.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Problem
      </h3>
      <p>
        The $30 billion health and fitness industry in the U.S. has been growing by at least 3-4% annually. With over 1 in 5 Americans belonging to at least one U.S. health club or studio, most people are intimidated by, or don’t know what to do when
        they first join a gym and/or start their fitness journey.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Solution
      </h3>
      <p>
        We created FitPath, an application to find workouts that fit their needs and goals. Our client wanted to enter the cloud storage & organizational market. In FitPath, workouts can be found within minutes, saved (into FitBoards), uploaded,
        shared, even and collaborated with trainers or other users in the form of videos, photos, documents, spreadsheets, and more.

      <h6>User Surveys</h6>
      <h3>Understanding our Target Market</h3>
      <p>I wanted to see how fitness enthusiasts, personal trainers, trainees, and other active people could benefit, so to learn about our target market, I created and sent a survey to my friends, fitness network, and other people on social media. I
        needed to learn:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If our users incorporates fitness into their lifestyle;</li>
        <li>Where our users like to workout;</li>
        <li>If users followed workouts on the web;</li>
        <li>The type of fitness/lifestyle goals our users would like to set for themselves;
        <li>How our users track their progress;</li>
        <li>What our users think the most valuable features are for tracking and reaching their fitness goals.</li>

      <h6>Competitive Analysis</h6>
      <h3>Looking at the current competition</h3>
      <p>I ran a competitive analysis so that we understand our target market and competition. Since we were still brand new in figuring out what type of product to create in the “cloud storage and organization market”, I chose three different
        companies: Dropbox, Pinterest, and a makeup beauty search engine named Mira to understand what they are doing well, and what problems could improve on. Dropbox is strictly cloud storage, one pinning and saving imagery and content from all
        over the web, and the last uses AI and pulls from reviews all over the internet to find the best makeup for users.
      </p>

      <img class="dropbox" src="images/fitpath/dropbox.jpg" alt="dropbox">
      <h5>Dropbox</h5>
      <p>“Dropbox is a place where all your team’s content comes together.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Strengths</strong>
        <br>
        No need to carry around a thumb drive anymore; can share files via email
        Simple and easy to use
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Weakness</strong>
        <br>
        The low conversion rate for individual users - free to be a paid user. Users could easily use another free cloud storage
        Cost per space is not as affordable to a general user
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Opportunities</strong>
        <br>
        Always innovating and adding more features
        Helps other businesses move towards working on the cloud - storing, organizing, and cross-collaboration
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Threats</strong>
        <br>
        Large corporations like Google already have a user base integrated with all other applications such as Google Chrome, so the engagement is high for them to use Google Drive rather than Dropbox
      </p>

      <img class="pinterest" src="images/fitpath/pinterest.jpg" alt="pinterest">
      <h5>Pinterest</h5>
      <p>A “visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes, home and style inspiration, and more.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Strengths</strong>
        <br>
        Boards are versatile and can be made for any type of category and interests, and creates a visual perspective
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Weaknesses</strong>
        <br>
        Seems to be geared more towards women, leaving the men out
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Opportunities</strong>
        <br>
        Helps drive traffic to websites from pinning photos, helps grow and create new customers, website leads, ROI, and direct conversion
        Helps plan life moments, an ideal home, vacation, food/cooking, accessories, beauty products, watches, and jewelry
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Threats</strong>
        <br>
        Pinterest’s biggest competitor is Amazon, but no other big competitor in this space
      </p>

      <img class="mira" src="images/fitpath/mira.jpg" alt="mira">
      <h5>Mira</h5>
      <p>“The beauty search engine app” that uses facial recognition and artificial intelligence to help pair users with the right products and beauty needs.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Strengths</strong>
        <br>
        An application that helps find beauty products based on your needs using artificial intelligence
        Analyzes product reviews from all over the web to see if products are good or bad; and summarized for the user. Should be getting smarter as users begin posting questions and answering product reviews
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Weaknesses</strong>
        <br>
        Brand new, only on iOS
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Opportunities</strong>
        <br>
        This seems like one of the first apps that pulls a lot of different products together into one space
        Helps someone into beauty find reviews and the right prices in one place
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Threats</strong>
        <br>
        It seemed like it took 2 years for the application to come out - in due time, will there be a competitor?

      <h3>Empathizing with our users</h3>
      <p>Taking all the information from our survey results, I analyzed the data and looked for patterns, trends, or outliers and created two personas to help put a name, face, and a backstory for all our potential users. By doing so, this helps
        better empathize with our users and understand the user’s goals, behaviors, and how they would interact with our application.</p>

      <h6>User Stories</h6>
      <h3>Stories for every user</h3>
      <p>Creating user stories helped me create and prioritize tasks that must be accounted for in the application.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>As a new user I want to find workouts that fit my needs / goals</li>
        <li>As a returning user I want to save workout content I find around the web (links, images, videos, etc)</li>
        <li>As a returning user, I want to organize workout content (into categories, groups, and/or folders)</li>
        <li>As a returning user, I want to share a single item with someone else/trainer (and vice versa - workout/photo)</li>

      <h3>Step by step, click by click, tap by tap.</h3>
      <p>Creating user flows helps us understand how each item relates to other items on each page on a website or in an application. Look back at the surveys, user personas, competitive analysis, user stories to help create these user flows.</p>
      <p>Anything at high priority from the user stories, I created a user flow and sketch before turning them to digital. I even included lower to medium user stories - but just enough for the MVP minimum viable product.</p>

      <p>I learned that as you go along the design process, any step of the way, like the user flows, don’t have to be set in stone, they could also change too after you build out wireframes.</p>

      <h6>Content Strategy</h6>
      <h3>Building the baseline of this application</h3>
      <p>At this point, I decided this is going to be a mobile application because when people workout, what devices do you usually see with them? Typically, I see them with mobile devices, if anything at all. Do we see people working out at the gym
        with their laptops? (I would like to build one in the roadmap ahead, but for now we will start with a mobile app). </p>
      <p>The Content Strategy phase helped build an overview map of how the application would work as well as help conceptualize what imagery I will use in the designs for implementing into the wireframes.</p>

      <h3>Building out the application</h3>
      <p>It was important to visualize our application in wireframes before we begin building. What if something didn’t work? When I built out the wireframes and began testing, I found during this process there were too many onboarding screens, and
        the same “share” buttons. Throughout this process, I was able to refine the application.</p>

      <h3>Testing the wireframes with our users</h3>
      <p>We tested out our user stories, made iterations to both the wireframes and the user stories, and then created a clickable prototype in InVision, and then running usability testing on the wireframes to make any changes if users ran into any
        issues. I found my users were having issues finding the “more options” button on each individual workout, and one of the menus needed work, so I made changes on these menus.</p>

    <!-- BRANDING -->
    <section>
      <h3>Mind Mapping & Sketching</h3>
      <p>For a long time throughout this process, this application remained nameless. I liked the idea of incorporating the word “fitness” and combining it with another word, so I created a mind mapping activity here which stems from the word
        “fitness” and goes to all these different ideas that I want to touch.  Once the name FitPath ws born, I began sketching out logos.</p>
      <img src="images/fitpath/fitpath_mindmapping.JPG" width=350 alt="mind mapping"><img src="images/fitpath/logosketches.JPG" width=350 alt="logo sketches">
      <p>I chose the name FitPath is because everyone goes on their own path, or journey, and this application allows you to find the best workouts that fit your needs - allowing you to make your path. Throughout your path, it doesn’t always have to
        be a linear line to your end goal, if in case life shifts or changes, you can make changes as necessary, as there isn’t just one way to get there.</p>
      <p>Some slogans can be: “Everyone creates their own fit path”.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- TYPOGRAPHY & LOGO-->
    <section>
      <h3>Typography & The FitPath Logo</h3>
      <p>This FitPath logo has a rectangle around “FitPath” which represents the path of your fitness journey. Throughout your path, it doesn’t always have to be a linear line to your end goal, if in case life shifts or changes, you can make changes
        as necessary, as there isn’t just one way to get there.</p>
      <p>I selected one of these logos and refined it with different fonts and weights. Looking at both fonts Montserrat and Roboto, I tested the logo with both.</p>
      <p>Refining the logo took some time and was refined and finished after building the style guide.</p>

      <p>Here are sketches of two possible options. Sketching helped get ideas down and took less than a minute to draw.</p>

      <p>Here is the FitPath logo created and refined by using Figma & Adobe Illustrator.</p>

        <p>The message I want to send to my users every day is to live a balanced and healthy life. I want to help find an easy way for my users to get started and stay motivated on their fit journey, or whichever path they want to take.</p>

        <p>I want the application to look clean, minimal, with a pop of color to be bright, but gender-neutral. We picked out typefaces, Monserrat and Hind, we chose colors in shades of blue.</p>

        <p>Creating the style guide helped set a baseline and turn the wireframes into higher fidelity screens.</p>

      <h3>Creating High Fidelity Mockups</h3>
      <img src="images/fitpath/hifimockups.jpg" alt="">
      <p>In this stage I began to build high fidelity mockups. I re-iterated my wireframing process especially referencing the user flows and after user testing.</p>

        <p>It took me a long time to transition into higher fidelity mockups going from empty wireframe squares to defined screens, but with the help of the style guide made consistency, and building them in Figma, it helped bring these screens to life.</p>

        <p>I learned that the design process helps lay the foundation for the high fidelity mockups and skipping a step early on could lead us to many more revisions in this phase.</p>

      <h6>Preference Testing & second round of testing</h6>
      <h3>Do you prefer this or that?</h3>
      <p>I went through a second round of testing, which both included preference testing and another clickable prototype. For Preference testing, I wanted to see where to include more branding colors on the application.</p>

        <p>From my 2nd clickable prototype testing, I ran three tests using Invision and Maze - two in person and one remote. Most users seemed to go through properly. Some users commented on the colors, but the biggest hurdle was finding the aqua
        “more” button on the bottom right-hand side of each card. Most users did not know exactly what the icon does, click it, or would be able to find it. Also, I found some of the secondary text was a little small or too light for them to see, so
        that was enlarged.</p>
      <img src="images/fitpath/preferencetesting2.jpg" width=1100 alt="">
      <p>Based on the feedback from these two tests, here’s what I changed on the design:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>• Added color to the navigation bars to empahsize which page they are on when selected</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>• Removed the “more” icon underneath each workout and added new buttons “Add” and “Share” to eliminate 1) ambiguity of the “more” icon and 2) an extra step/click for the user</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>• Enlarged some secondary text that was too small for readers, with maintaining heiarchy</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Finishing Touches</h6>
      <h3>The Finishing Touches</h3>
      <p>With all the feedback from the users and lead designers, we then revised the finishing touches. The biggest patterns I learned from reiterations and feedback were three things:  </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>1. To maintain consistency is across each screen. This took a long time, with the number of screens I have.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>2. Change the behavior of an aqua “more button” on the bottom right of the workouts to to a readible “add” and “share” clickable icon on each workout card.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>This eliminated an extra menu, step, and thought process a user needed to go through</p>

      <p>Following most of my steps from the User Personas, User Flows, to the Wireframes, then to the prototypes helped create a base formality of the application FitPath. Having a solid Style Guide helped to transform the screens into high fidelity
        mockups.</p>

        <p>What surprised me the most was the transition phase from wireframes to high fidelity screens. I needed time to sit back, envision, and then refine the screens. I learned that ensuring all elements were the same sizes and aligned throughout
        the entire design helped make everything look much more polished.</p>

        <p>If I was given more time, I would have made my prototype almost fully functional. Currently, not all screens are built out, but the functionality is there.</p>

        <p>I hope you enjoyed this case study!</p>
